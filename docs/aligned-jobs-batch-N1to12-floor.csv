# AlignedJobs CSV: export alignedN1..12 for a pressure sweep around the N1 floor
#
# Notes
# - Run via StrokeSampler: `Run AlignedJobs CSV`
# - This file contains only the fields that the CSV runner currently consumes.
# - start/end/outW/outH/scale/period are taken from the current UI values at runtime (not from this CSV),
#   unless you add the optional columns shown in the commented template below.
#
# Minimal columns
pressure_start,pressure_end,pressure_step,aligned_n,trials,runTag

# Optional override template (uncomment and add values if you want CSV-driven geometry/output too)
